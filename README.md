# 🐾 Virtual Pet – Python OOP Challenge

Welcome to the **Virtual Pet** Python project! This fun challenge helps you practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python by creating and interacting with your own digital pet.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a pet simulator using classes, attributes, methods, and constructors. Your pet can eat, sleep, play, and even learn new tricks!

## 🐶 Features

- 🍗 `eat()` – Reduces hunger and boosts happiness
- 😴 `sleep()` – Boosts energy
- 🎾 `play()` – Boosts happiness, decreases energy, and increases hunger
- 🎓 `train(trick)` – Teaches your pet a new trick if it has enough energy
- 🧠 `get_status()` – Displays the pet's current mood
- 🐾 `show_tricks()` – Lists all learned tricks

Bonus: Includes emoji-enhanced interaction and basic error-handling (e.g., can't play/train if too tired)
